# n64_2_usb

tuned the joystick, as none of my n64 controllers were able to reach the max/min values of 127 and -127.
they were only reaching values of around 80 or 90 and -80 or -90. (see: arduino->map)
aslo added a small deadzone to the joystick.
I added a switch function for debugging, and tweaked the output of it.
